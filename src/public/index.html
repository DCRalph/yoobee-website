          At Burgurfuel, we believe that great food shouldn't compromise on
          quality or taste. Our story begins with a passion for burgers that are
          made with fresh, high-quality ingredients and grilled to perfection.
          We wanted to create a place where everyone could enjoy a delicious,
          mouth-watering burger in a welcoming and fun atmosphere...

              Like a fine single malt whiskey, every now and then we have to put
              a "The" in front of it. It takes certain qualities to take a guy
              like this down because if you're not ready for it it's like a
              punch in the face with a fistful of flavour.

              There's nothing more Kiwi than a burger with beetroot and egg in
              it, except for maybe a Kiwi burger company making that Kiwi burger
              or a burger made out of Kiwis perhaps.

              Whatever you do, don't eat this burger first. It may be the last
              burger you ever eat. A lot of people get stuck on this burger, as
              in, it's packed full of so much om and nom, it's like the Cookie
              Monster after his first cookie... heck, his name just used to be
              "Monster".
